I wanted to enter a simple check list for myself, what will i do in this november.

1- I bought Max's new Javascript course which has more than 40 hours content. Except nodejs part i am going to finish it, to sharp my Javascript skills

I'm trying to be a professional web developer. Being exper on JS is something necessary.

I already know, but i always felt, i should be better on that. In a month i will finish it slowly.

2- I'm slowly reading Alex Edward's Let's Go book to learn and making my own diary app, at the end of the month i will be very close to end of the book and my app.

3- I also started to make a Django application about finding football game players for carpet pitch games which are very popular in my country, Turkey. I'm going to finish and deploy it in this month.

That's all. If i like this check list, i will make more in the future. First gotta finish all of them.
